# Coding advice by category
ORACLE_RESPONSES[debugging]="üîç **The Debug Oracle speaks:** Your bug is not your enemy, but your teacher. Listen to its whispers in the console logs. The answer lies not in the code you wrote, but in the code you didn't write. Check your assumptions like you check your syntax - carefully and often."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[career]="üíº **The Career Oracle reveals:** Your next opportunity will come disguised as a problem you've never solved before. Embrace the unknown languages, the scary architectures, the impossible deadlines. Growth lives in the gap between comfort and capability."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[learning]="üìö **The Learning Oracle whispers:** The best developers are not those who know everything, but those who know how to learn anything. Your curiosity is your superpower. Follow the threads that fascinate you - they lead to mastery."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[teamwork]="üë• **The Collaboration Oracle counsels:** The strongest code is written by the humblest developers. Listen more than you speak in code reviews. Teach without condescension, learn without ego. Your team is your greatest compiler - let them optimize your thinking."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[burnout]="üî• **The Wellness Oracle warns:** Code is infinite, but you are not. Rest is not the absence of productivity, but the foundation of it. Your best solutions come not from grinding, but from stepping back and seeing the forest for the trees."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[imposter_syndrome]="üë§ **The Confidence Oracle affirms:** Every expert was once a beginner. Every master once searched Stack Overflow for basic syntax. Your journey is valid, your progress is real, and your questions are welcome. You belong here."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[technology_choice]="üõ†Ô∏è **The Technology Oracle advises:** The best framework is the one your team understands. The best language is the one that solves your problem. The best architecture is the one you can maintain. Choose simplicity over cleverness, clarity over performance, unless performance truly matters."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[legacy_code]="üèõÔ∏è **The Legacy Oracle sighs:** This code was written by developers who faced different constraints, different deadlines, different knowledge. Honor their effort while improving their work. Refactor with respect, not judgment."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[side_projects]="üöÄ **The Side Project Oracle encourages:** Your side projects are not just code - they are dreams given form. Some will fly, some will crash, but all will teach you something you couldn't learn at work. Keep building, keep dreaming."

ORACLE_RESPONSES[open_source]="üåü **The Open Source Oracle enlightens:** Contributing to open source is like leaving flowers on the path for other travelers. Your pull request, no matter how small, makes the developer ecosystem a little bit better for everyone who comes after you."

# Specific technical advice
declare -A TECHNICAL_ORACLE

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[git_conflicts]="üåø **Git Wisdom:** Merge conflicts are not failures, they are conversations between different versions of truth. Take time to understand what each side was trying to accomplish before choosing the path forward."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[testing]="üß™ **Testing Wisdom:** Tests are love letters to your future self. Write them as if the person maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live - and that person is you, six months from now."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[performance]="‚ö° **Performance Wisdom:** Premature optimization is the root of all evil, but so is ignoring performance until it's too late. Measure first, optimize second, profile always."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[security]="üîí **Security Wisdom:** Trust is a vulnerability. Validate all inputs as if they come from your most creative adversary. Security is not a feature you add - it's a mindset you adopt."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[documentation]="üìù **Documentation Wisdom:** Code tells you how, comments tell you why, documentation tells you when to care. Write docs for the developer you were six months ago - confused, eager, and slightly panicked."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[debugging]="üêõ **Debugging Wisdom:** Your bug is not your enemy, but your teacher. Listen to its whispers in the console logs. The answer lies not in the code you wrote, but in the code you didn't write. Check your assumptions like you check your syntax - carefully and often."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[code_review]="üëÄ **Code Review Wisdom:** Review code as if you're mentoring your past self. Be kind but thorough, specific but not pedantic. The best reviews teach principles, not just point out problems. Remember: you're reviewing code, not critiquing the coder."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[learning]="üìö **Learning Wisdom:** Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up. Start small, build consistently, and embrace the confusion - it means you're growing. The path from 'I have no idea' to 'I got this' is shorter than you think."

TECHNICAL_ORACLE[career_start]="üå± **Career Starting Wisdom:** Your first job won't be your last, your first language won't be your only one, and your first mistake won't define you. Focus on learning, asking good questions, and building things. The rest will follow."

# Technical Debt Oracle responses and analysis
TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[architecture_debt]="üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Debt Oracle:** Your codebase has grown organically, like a city without urban planning. What once was a charming village of functions has become a sprawling metropolis of dependencies. Time to draw some maps, establish some districts, and maybe build a few bridges where there are currently only dark alleys."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[documentation_debt]="üìö **Documentation Debt Oracle:** Your code speaks in ancient tongues that only you can decipher. Future developers will need a Rosetta Stone to understand your intentions. The debt isn't in what you wrote, but in what you forgot to explain. Consider this: if your code is poetry, your comments should be the translation."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[testing_debt]="üß™ **Testing Debt Oracle:** You've built a beautiful glass house but forgotten to install smoke detectors. Your code works today, but will it work tomorrow? Testing debt is like insurance - boring until you need it, essential when disaster strikes. Start small: test the parts that would hurt most if they broke."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[refactoring_debt]="üîÑ **Refactoring Debt Oracle:** Your code has accumulated layers like an archaeological site - each commit a new stratum of history. Some functions have grown so complex they deserve their own zip code. The Oracle sees three paths: divide the giants, simplify the tangles, or document the maze so others can navigate it."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[dependency_debt]="üì¶ **Dependency Debt Oracle:** Your package.json reads like a phone book from the early 2000s. You've collected dependencies like a digital hoarder - some useful, some forgotten, some actively harmful. Time for a Marie Kondo session: does this package spark joy? If not, thank it for its service and delete it."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[performance_debt]="‚ö° **Performance Debt Oracle:** Your application runs, but with the grace of a three-legged elephant. Performance debt is often invisible until it becomes unbearable. The Oracle suggests: measure first, optimize second, and remember - the fastest code is the code that doesn't run at all."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[security_debt]="üîí **Security Debt Oracle:** You've built fortifications from the outside but left the windows unlocked. Security debt compounds faster than credit card interest and can be just as devastating. Every TODO comment about 'fixing this later' is a potential vulnerability. Later is now."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[maintainability_debt]="üõ†Ô∏è **Maintainability Debt Oracle:** Your code works, but maintaining it requires the skills of an archaeologist, the patience of a saint, and the courage of a debugger. Maintainability debt is the most insidious kind - it doesn't break things, it just makes everything harder. Invest in clarity today, thank yourself tomorrow."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[configuration_debt]="‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Debt Oracle:** Your project has more configuration files than a bureaucratic maze. Environment-specific settings are scattered like Easter eggs throughout your codebase. The Oracle sees a path: centralize the chaos, version the variables, and document the decisions."

TECHNICAL_DEBT_ORACLE[error_handling_debt]="üö® **Error Handling Debt Oracle:** Your code assumes a world where nothing goes wrong - a beautiful but naive perspective. When exceptions happen (and they will), your application throws tantrums like a toddler in a toy store. Graceful failure is an art form worth mastering."
