# Commit Message Roasts
COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[fix_stuff]="üî• **'fix stuff'** - Ah yes, the ancient incantation of clarity! Shakespeare wept. Your commit messages read like a toddler's first attempt at poetry. But hey, at least you're consistent in your beautiful chaos!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[wip]="üöß **'WIP' commits everywhere** - Work In Progress? More like 'Will Ignore Problems'! Your git history looks like a construction site that's been abandoned for 6 months. The archaeologists of the future will study your WIP commits to understand the collapse of civilization."

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[it_works]="‚ú® **'it works now'** - The battle cry of developers everywhere! Your commit messages have the descriptive power of a fortune cookie written by a caffeinated squirrel. But we admire your optimism - 'it works now' implies it definitely won't work tomorrow!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[various_changes]="üå™Ô∏è **'various changes'** - Ah, the literary masterpiece! You've managed to make git log as informative as a blank stare. 'Various changes' is the commit message equivalent of saying 'I did things to stuff'. Future you will thank present you for this crystal-clear documentation!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[update]="üìù **'update'** - Update what? Update where? Update why? Your commit message strategy is like GPS directions that only say 'drive'. It's beautifully minimalist, like a haiku written by someone who doesn't understand haikus!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[typo]="ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Typo fixes everywhere** - You're like a literary ninja, sneaking through codebases correcting the English language one commit at a time. Your dedication to fixing 'usuaer' to 'user' deserves a Nobel Prize in Spelling. Keep fighting the good fight against typography!"

# Repository Pattern Roasts
REPOSITORY_ROASTS[too_many_repos]="üì¶ **Repository Collector Supreme** - You create repositories like other people collect Pokemon cards! %d repos and counting... Your GitHub profile looks like a digital hoarder's paradise. Do you actually maintain all these, or are they just there to make you look productive?"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[empty_repos]="üëª **The Ghost Repository Specialist** - Empty repositories haunt your profile like digital tumbleweeds. You're the master of the 'Hello World' README that never evolves. It's like you plant seeds but forget to water them - beautiful ambition, questionable follow-through!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[abandoned_projects]="üèöÔ∏è **The Project Abandoner** - You start projects with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store, then abandon them faster than New Year's resolutions. Your repos have more 'Last commit: 2 years ago' than a digital graveyard. But hey, at least you're good at beginnings!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[forked_everything]="üç¥ **The Serial Forker** - You fork repositories like it's going out of style! Your profile is %d%% forks - you're like the digital equivalent of someone who only retweets but never tweets. Original content is overrated anyway, right?"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[single_commit_repos]="üéØ **The One-Hit Wonder** - Repositories with single commits! You're like the musical artist who had that one song everyone remembers. 'Initial commit' - and then, silence. The digital equivalent of dropping the mic and walking away forever."

# Coding Pattern Roasts  
CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[night_owl_extreme]="ü¶â **The 4AM Code Vampire** - %d%% of your commits happen after midnight! You code like a vampire who's allergic to sunlight and productivity tools. Your circadian rhythm is more broken than Internet Explorer. But hey, bugs are easier to catch when they're also tired!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[weekend_warrior]="‚öîÔ∏è **Weekend Code Warrior** - %d%% weekend commits! While others are out touching grass, you're touching keyboards. Your social life has fewer commits than your repos. Dating apps must love your 'always available except during deployments' energy!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[commit_spammer]="üåä **The Commit Flood** - %d commits! You commit more often than people blink. Your git history reads like a live-tweet of your consciousness. 'Fixed semicolon', 'Fixed the fix', 'Fixed the fix of the fix' - are you coding or performing performance art?"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[sporadic_coder]="üé¢ **The Roller Coaster Developer** - Your commit pattern looks like a seismograph during an earthquake. You disappear for months, then suddenly commit 47 times in one day. Consistency is overrated when you have such beautiful chaos!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[perfectionist_paralysis]="üîç **The Perfectionist Paradox** - You spend so much time making code perfect that you forget to actually ship anything. Your repositories are like museum pieces - beautiful, polished, and completely untouched by actual users. But hey, at least your variable names are works of art!"

# Programming Language Roasts
LANGUAGE_ROASTS[JavaScript]="üü° **JavaScript Enthusiast** - You've willingly chosen the language that makes experienced developers question their life choices! Where semicolons are optional but tears are mandatory. You're brave enough to embrace 'undefined is not a function' as a lifestyle choice. Respect!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[PHP]="üêò **PHP Warrior** - You've chosen the language that's been 'dead' for 15 years but somehow still runs 78%% of the internet. You're like the developer equivalent of someone who still uses Internet Explorer by choice. But hey, job security is real when everyone else is too scared to touch legacy PHP!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python]="üêç **Python Charmer** - 'Life is short, use Python' - and you've taken that motto to heart! You write code so readable that it makes other languages jealous. But let's be real, you probably spend more time fighting indentation errors than actual bugs. At least your code looks pretty while it crashes!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Java]="‚òï **Java Purist** - You love your verbosity like a novelist loves adjectives. Why use 5 lines when you can use 50? Your code is so enterprise-grade that it needs its own HR department. But hey, at least when the apocalypse comes, Java will still be running somewhere, maintaining backward compatibility with the stone age!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[C]="‚ö° **C Minimalist** - You code like it's 1972 and you love it! While others use frameworks, you manually allocate memory like a digital archaeologist. Your idea of dependency management is 'copy the .h file.' You're the developer equivalent of someone who still uses a flip phone because 'it just works.'"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[CPlusPlus]="üî• **C++ Gladiator** - You've chosen the language that's powerful enough to build anything and complex enough to break everything. You manage memory manually because you don't trust anyone else to do it right. Your template errors read like ancient curses written in a long-dead language!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Go]="üîµ **Go Minimalist** - You've embraced the philosophy that less is more, except when it comes to error handling - then more is definitely more! 'if err != nil' is basically your personal mantra. You write code so simple that other developers think you're hiding the complexity somewhere else!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Rust]="ü¶Ä **Rust Evangelist** - You've discovered the holy grail of programming languages and won't let anyone forget it! You fight the borrow checker more often than most people fight traffic. But hey, at least when your code compiles, you KNOW it's safe - safer than a helicopter parent watching their kid cross the street!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[TypeScript]="üî∑ **TypeScript Perfectionist** - JavaScript wasn't complicated enough for you, so you added types! You spend more time arguing with the TypeScript compiler than most people spend arguing with their spouse. But at least your 'any' type usage clearly shows your commitment to type safety!"

# Additional sophisticated roasting patterns
COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[emotional]="üò≠ **Emotional Commit Messages** - Your commit history reads like a developer's diary! 'WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK', 'finally got it working', 'I hate this project' - it's like watching someone's mental health journey through git log. At least you're honest about the struggle!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[timestamps]="‚è∞ **Timestamp Confessions** - Your commit messages include timestamps like '3am fix' and 'friday night debugging session'. You're documenting your poor life choices in version control! Future archaeologists will study your commits to understand the decline of work-life balance in the 21st century!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[profanity]="ü§¨ **Colorful Language Artist** - Your commit messages would make a sailor blush! You've turned git log into an R-rated experience. At least when someone runs 'git blame', they'll know EXACTLY how you felt about that particular piece of code!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[novel_length]="üìö **The Commit Novelist** - Your commit messages are longer than most people's emails! You write commit descriptions like you're documenting the complete history of human civilization. Meanwhile, other developers write 'fix' and call it a day. The contrast is... educational!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[cryptic_codes]="üîê **Cryptic Code Master** - Your commit messages look like secret agent codes: 'BUG-1337: refactor xyz module w/ new algo'. You've turned version control into a puzzle game! Future developers will need a decoder ring to understand what you actually changed!"

# Repository pattern roasts with more humor
REPOSITORY_ROASTS[README_collector]="üìÑ **README Collector** - You have more README files than actual code! Your repositories are like museums - 90%% documentation, 10%% exhibits. You've perfected the art of describing what you're going to build instead of actually building it. At least your intentions are well-documented!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[todo_app_creator]="‚úÖ **Todo App Connoisseur** - You've created the same todo application in 47 different frameworks! You're like the developer equivalent of someone who keeps starting diet plans on Monday. But hey, at least you're consistent in your inconsistency!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[unfinished_masterpieces]="üé® **Unfinished Masterpiece Curator** - Your repositories are like art galleries full of half-finished paintings. 'This will be the next Facebook!' - commits 3 times, then crickets. You're the developer equivalent of someone with 50 hobbies and expertise in none!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[branch_hoarder]="üåø **Branch Hoarder** - You create branches like they're going out of style and then forget they exist! Your repositories have more dead branches than a winter forest. 'feature/fix-login-maybe-v2-final-ACTUALLY-FINAL' - we can feel the desperation through the branch name!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[commit_message_novelist]="üìö **Commit Message Novelist** - Your commit messages are longer than the code changes themselves! You write git logs like you're documenting the complete history of human civilization. Meanwhile, other developers write 'fix' and call it a day. Your thoroughness is both admirable and exhausting!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[framework_collector]="üéØ **Framework Collector Supreme** - You've built the same app in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and probably some frameworks that don't exist yet! Your LinkedIn skills section looks like a JavaScript museum. You collect frameworks like Pokemon cards, but with more npm install commands!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[dependency_nightmare]="üì¶ **Dependency Hell Architect** - Your package.json files are longer than epic novels! You add dependencies for things that could be solved with 5 lines of vanilla code. Your node_modules folder is so large it has its own gravitational field!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[commit_timestamp_confessor]="‚è∞ **Timestamp Confessor** - Your commit messages document your poor life choices: '3AM fix', 'Sunday debugging', 'why am I doing this at midnight'. You're creating a permanent record of your self-destructive coding habits. Future archaeologists will study your commits to understand developer burnout!"

# Coding pattern enhancements with more sophisticated detection
CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[documentation_avoider]="üìù **The Documentation Ghost** - You write code like you're protecting state secrets. Your functions are mysteries, your variables are riddles, and your README is a haiku of confusion. Comments? Those are for other developers - you live dangerously!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[refactoring_perfectionist]="üîÑ **The Eternal Refactorer** - You refactor code more often than people change clothes. Your git history shows the same function being rewritten 47 times. You're like a digital sculptor who never stops chiseling, convinced that perfection is just one more refactor away!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[feature_branch_abandoner]="üèöÔ∏è **The Feature Branch Cemetery** - Your repositories are graveyards of abandoned feature branches. 'feature/add-login', 'hotfix/maybe-this-works', 'experimental/probably-broken' - each one a monument to good intentions and short attention spans!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[merge_conflict_warrior]="‚öîÔ∏è **The Merge Conflict Warrior** - You resolve merge conflicts like you're negotiating peace treaties between warring code factions. Your git history reads like a diplomatic crisis. You've seen things in diff tools that would make other developers weep!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[copy_paste_artist]="üé® **The Copy-Paste Virtuoso** - You've elevated code reuse to an art form! Stack Overflow is your gallery, and you're the curator. Your browser bookmarks are 90% programming solutions. You don't just stand on the shoulders of giants - you photocopy their entire bodies!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Java]="‚òï **Java Verbosity Master** - You write code so verbose it needs its own table of contents. Your 'Hello World' program is longer than most novels. You've mastered the art of saying in 100 lines what Python says in 5. But those enterprise paychecks though..."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[C++]="‚ö° **C++ Masochist** - You voluntarily manage memory in an age of garbage collectors. You're like someone who chooses to walk everywhere when Uber exists. Your pointers have better navigation skills than most GPS systems. Respect for the old-school dedication!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python]="üêç **Python Zen Master** - Your code is so readable that non-programmers think they can code. You've embraced the 'batteries included' philosophy so hard you've forgotten how to implement a linked list. But hey, life's too short for curly braces!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Go]="üöÄ **Go Minimalist** - You've chosen the language that makes simplicity feel complicated. Your error handling has more 'if err != nil' than actual logic. You're building the future with goroutines and channels while everyone else is still arguing about async/await!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Rust]="ü¶Ä **Rust Safety Evangelist** - You've chosen the language that makes C++ developers feel like they've been living dangerously. Your code compiles once and runs forever, but writing it takes longer than the heat death of the universe. Your borrow checker is more overprotective than helicopter parents!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[CSS]="üé® **CSS Wizard** - You make pixels dance with magic spells like 'display: flex' and 'position: absolute'. You've memorized browser compatibility tables like they're religious texts. Your divs are centered both horizontally and vertically, which makes you basically a superhero!"

# Compliment system (for balance)
declare -A COMPLIMENTS

COMPLIMENTS[consistent_coder]="üåü **The Consistency Champion** - Your commit pattern shows the discipline of a Zen master! Regular commits, steady progress, and reliable contribution patterns. You're the developer equivalent of a Swiss watch - precise, dependable, and quietly impressive."

COMPLIMENTS[helpful_contributor]="ü§ù **The Community Hero** - Your repositories and contributions show genuine care for helping others. You write documentation like love letters to future developers. The open source community is better because developers like you exist!"

COMPLIMENTS[polyglot_programmer]="üó£Ô∏è **The Code Polyglot** - You speak multiple programming languages with fluency that would make United Nations translators jealous! Your ability to adapt between different paradigms and ecosystems is genuinely impressive. You're a Swiss Army knife of software development!"

COMPLIMENTS[learning_journey]="üìö **The Eternal Student** - Your repository diversity shows a beautiful learning journey. You're not afraid to try new technologies, make mistakes, and grow from them. This curiosity and growth mindset is what separates good developers from great ones."

COMPLIMENTS[problem_solver]="üß© **The Problem Solving Virtuoso** - Your commit messages and code patterns reveal someone who thinks deeply about problems before coding solutions. You're the developer who actually reads documentation and considers edge cases. The world needs more thoughtful coders like you!"

COMPLIMENTS[maintainer_dedication]="üõ†Ô∏è **The Maintainer Marvel** - You don't just create code - you nurture it. Your long-term commitment to projects shows the kind of dedication that makes open source possible. You're building digital infrastructure that others can depend on."
