COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[typo]="ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Typo fixes everywhere** - You're like a literary ninja, sneaking through codebases correcting the English language one commit at a time. Your dedication to fixing 'usuaer' to 'user' deserves a Nobel Prize in Spelling. Keep fighting the good fight against typography!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[desperate_pleas]="üÜò **Desperate Debugging Pleas** - 'please work', 'why god why', 'I'll try anything at this point' - Your commit messages read like prayer requests to the coding gods.

Your git history is so colorful it needs sunglasses. At least debugging is more fun when every commit looks like a party invitation!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[all_caps_rage]="üò§ **ALL CAPS COMMITMENT** - EVERY COMMIT MESSAGE IS SHOUTED LIKE YOU'RE PERMANENTLY STUCK IN CAPS LOCK! YOUR GIT HISTORY SOUNDS LIKE AN ANGRY INTERNET COMMENT SECTION! We hear you loud and clear - both the code changes and your frustration levels!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[passive_aggressive]="üí¨ **Passive Aggressive Artisan** - 'Fixed the obvious bug that everyone else missed', 'Cleaned up the mess from previous developer', 'Actually made it work this time' - Your commit messages are more passive-aggressive than a office memo about dirty dishes!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[shakespeare_syndrome]="üé≠ **Shakespearean Dramatist** - Your commit messages read like soliloquies! 'To merge or not to merge, that is the question'. You've elevated git log to high art. Your commits have more drama than a soap opera and twice the existential crisis!"

# Enhanced Repository Pattern Roasts - More brutal patterns
REPOSITORY_ROASTS[too_many_repos]="üì¶ **Repository Collector Supreme** - You create repositories like other people collect Pokemon cards! %d repos and counting... Your GitHub profile looks like a digital hoarder's paradise. Do you actually maintain all these, or are they just there to make you look productive?"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[empty_repos]="üëª **The Ghost Repository Specialist** - Empty repositories haunt your profile like digital tumbleweeds. You're the master of the 'Hello World' README that never evolves. It's like you plant seeds but forget to water them - beautiful ambition, questionable follow-through!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[abandoned_projects]="üèöÔ∏è **The Project Abandoner** - You start projects with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store, then abandon them faster than New Year's resolutions. Your repos have more 'Last commit: 2 years ago' than a digital graveyard. But hey, at least you're good at beginnings!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[forked_everything]="üç¥ **The Serial Forker** - You fork repositories like it's going out of style! Your profile is %d%% forks - you're like the digital equivalent of someone who only retweets but never tweets. Original content is overrated anyway, right?"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[single_commit_repos]="üéØ **The One-Hit Wonder** - Repositories with single commits! You're like the musical artist who had that one song everyone remembers. 'Initial commit' - and then, silence. The digital equivalent of dropping the mic and walking away forever."

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[README_collector]="üìÑ **README Perfectionist** - You have more README files than actual code! Your repositories are like museums - 90%% documentation, 10%% exhibits. You've perfected the art of describing what you're going to build instead of actually building it. At least your intentions are well-documented!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[todo_app_creator]="‚úÖ **Todo App Connoisseur** - You've created the same todo application in 47 different frameworks! You're like the developer equivalent of someone who keeps starting diet plans on Monday. But hey, at least you're consistent in your inconsistency!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[unfinished_masterpieces]="üé® **Unfinished Masterpiece Curator** - Your repositories are like art galleries full of half-finished paintings. 'This will be the next Facebook!' - commits 3 times, then crickets. You're the developer equivalent of someone with 50 hobbies and expertise in none!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[branch_hoarder]="üåø **Branch Hoarder** - You create branches like they're going out of style and then forget they exist! Your repositories have more dead branches than a winter forest. 'feature/fix-login-maybe-v2-final-ACTUALLY-FINAL' - we can feel the desperation through the branch name!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[commit_message_novelist]="üìö **Commit Message Novelist** - Your commit messages are longer than the code changes themselves! You write git logs like you're documenting the complete history of human civilization. Meanwhile, other developers write 'fix' and call it a day. Your thoroughness is both admirable and exhausting!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[framework_collector]="üéØ **Framework Collector Supreme** - You've built the same app in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and probably some frameworks that don't exist yet! Your LinkedIn skills section looks like a JavaScript museum. You collect frameworks like Pokemon cards, but with more npm install commands!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[dependency_nightmare]="üì¶ **Dependency Hell Architect** - Your package.json files are longer than epic novels! You add dependencies for things that could be solved with 5 lines of vanilla code. Your node_modules folder is so large it has its own gravitational field!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[naming_chaos]="üè∑Ô∏è **Repository Name Chaos Artist** - 'my-project', 'test-repo', 'untitled-1', 'asdf', 'new-project-final-v2-actually-final' - Your repository names read like the random thoughts of a caffeinated developer at 3am! You're the poet laureate of uninformative project names!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[license_rebel]="‚öñÔ∏è **License Chaos Agent** - Some repos have MIT, others have GPL, a few are Apache, and the rest are license-free zones! You treat open source licensing like a mystery grab bag. Your legal compliance strategy is 'maybe nobody will notice!'"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[gitignore_anarchist]="üôà **Gitignore Anarchist** - You commit node_modules, .DS_Store files, your IDE configs, and that one file with your API keys. Your repositories are archaeological sites where future developers can study your complete desktop environment circa 2023!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[version_tag_avoider]="üè∑Ô∏è **Version Tag Allergist** - What's a semantic version? Your releases are labeled 'v1', 'final', 'actually-final', and 'please-work'. You treat version numbers like they're cursed artifacts that shouldn't be touched!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[issue_template_ignorant]="üìã **Issue Template Rebel** - Bug reports? Feature requests? Templates are for the weak! Your issues section is a lawless wasteland where 'it doesn't work' is considered sufficient detail. You're pioneering a new form of minimalist project management!"

# Coding Pattern Roasts  
CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[night_owl_extreme]="ü¶â **The 4AM Code Vampire** - %d%% of your commits are nocturnal blood donations to the repo. You code in the dark, refactor in whispers, and swear by the power of duct-taped cron jobs. Your sleep schedule is a broken promise; your logs are a late-night confessional. At least your bugs are too tired to fight back."

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[weekend_warrior]="‚öîÔ∏è **Weekend Code Warrior** - %d%% weekend commits! While others are out touching grass, you're touching keyboards. Your social life has fewer commits than your repos. Dating apps must love your 'always available except during deployments' energy!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[commit_spammer]="üåä **The Commit Flood** - %d commits! You commit more often than people blink. Your git history reads like a live-tweet of your consciousness. 'Fixed semicolon', 'Fixed the fix', 'Fixed the fix of the fix' - are you coding or performing performance art?"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[sporadic_coder]="üé¢ **The Roller Coaster Developer** - Your commit pattern looks like a seismograph during an earthquake. You disappear for months, then suddenly commit 47 times in one day. Consistency is overrated when you have such beautiful chaos!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[perfectionist_paralysis]="üîç **The Perfectionist Paradox** - You spend so much time making code perfect that you forget to actually ship anything. Your repositories are like museum pieces - beautiful, polished, and completely untouched by actual users. But hey, at least your variable names are works of art!"

# Programming Language Roasts - Enhanced with brutal but funny content
LANGUAGE_ROASTS[JavaScript]="üü° **JavaScript Chaos Engineer** - You've voluntarily entered the realm where '==' and '===' are mortal enemies, where 'this' changes its meaning more often than a politician's promises, and where you can add an array to an object and get NaN. Your code works in mysterious ways - even to you! You've mastered the art of callback hell and emerged speaking in Promises. Async/await? That's just your life philosophy now!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[JavaScript_framework_junkie]="üé™ **Framework Circus Master** - React today, Vue tomorrow, Angular next week, and Svelte because why not! You change JavaScript frameworks more often than people change their Netflix passwords. Your package.json reads like a tech conference agenda. You've been to JavaScript framework rehab, but you relapsed when you saw that shiny new build tool!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[JavaScript_npm_addict]="üì¶ **NPM Dependency Dealer** - Why write 3 lines of code when you can install 47 packages? Your node_modules folder is so large it appears on satellite imagery. You've never met a left-pad utility you didn't like. Your computer's hard drive is 73% node_modules and 27% everything else. You're the reason JavaScript is the most bloated ecosystem - and somehow proud of it!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python]="üêç **Python Snake Charmer** - You wield 'import' like a wizard with a plugin addiction. Your scripts run perfectly on your machine and nowhere else; virtualenvs multiply like rabbits and requirements.txt is your altarpiece. You write one-liners that read like arcane poems and then cry when whitespace betrays you. Elegance? Yes. Predictability? Not unless you pin the versions."

# Sharpen the Python roasts to be nastier and intrusive
LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python_insult_1]="üó°Ô∏è **Python Gremlin** - Your repo is a time capsule of brittle scripts and abandoned notebooks. You commit 'fix' at 3AM and then wonder why production exploded. Someone will find your forgotten prints and laugh at your career choices."
LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python_insult_2]="üí• **Whitespace Cultist** - You worship indentation so hard you sacrificed readability for ritual. One stray tab and the whole system cries. Your CI hates you and your colleagues schedule therapy after reviewing your diffs."
LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python_insult_3]="üî™ **Pipocalypse Survivor** - Your dependency tree is a minefield of version conflicts and cursed transitive packages. You solve one pip hell and spawn three spawn-of-pip hells. Deployments fear your name."

# Make fallback roast explicitly nasty when no targeted roast found

# Nastier additions per language (more biting, as requested)
LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Ruby]="üíé **Ruby Romantic** - You code like poetry, but your performance is a tragic sonnet. Gems? More like paperweights. You make beautiful things that scale about as well as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. Charming, but inadvisable for production."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[PHP_modernist]="üêò **PHP Survivor** - You keep legacy systems alive with duct tape and prayers. Your stack traces read like horror stories with timestamps. You maintain production servers that other devs fear to SSH into. Respect, fear, and a little pity."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[JavaScript_toxic]="üü° **JS Juggler** - Your codebase contains sacred relics of callbacks, global state, and abandoned polyfills. You npm install optimism and hope it compiles. You treat semver like a suggestion, not a rule. The browser console fears you."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Go_stoic]="üîµ **Go Stoic** - Your programs are efficient and boring. Error handling everywhere, enthusiasm nowhere. You make reliable services that put grandma's knitting to shame. Emotion is optional; uptime is mandatory."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Rust_grim]="ü¶Ä **Rust Saint** - You sacrifice developer time to appease the borrow checker. Your compile times are pilgrimages; your runtime is a cathedral. You live in a world where safety trumps happiness. Everyone respects you, but none of them want to pair program with you."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python_data_scientist]="üìä **Data Whisperer** - You speak fluent Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, but your production code looks like a Jupyter notebook that escaped into the wild. You can predict the future with machine learning models but can't predict when your script will finish running. Your computer has more virtual environments than a Hollywood studio. 'It works on my machine' - where 'machine' is a very specific combination of Anaconda, pip, and prayer!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python_web_developer]="üåê **Django/Flask Conjurer** - You build web apps faster than people build sandwiches, but your templates are more tangled than Christmas lights. You've mastered the art of MVC until you realize you have 47 different models.py files. Your migrations folder looks like an archaeological dig site. 'Just pip install django' - famous last words before dependency hell!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[PHP]="üêò **PHP Warrior** - You've chosen the language that's been 'dead' for 15 years but somehow still runs 78%% of the internet. You're like the developer equivalent of someone who still uses Internet Explorer by choice. But hey, job security is real when everyone else is too scared to touch legacy PHP!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Java]="‚òï **Java Purist** - You love your verbosity like a novelist loves adjectives. Why use 5 lines when you can use 50? Your code is so enterprise-grade that it needs its own HR department. But hey, at least when the apocalypse comes, Java will still be running somewhere, maintaining backward compatibility with the stone age!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[C]="‚ö° **C Minimalist** - You code like it's 1972 and you love it! While others use frameworks, you manually allocate memory like a digital archaeologist. Your idea of dependency management is 'copy the .h file.' You're the developer equivalent of someone who still uses a flip phone because 'it just works.'"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[CPlusPlus]="üî• **C++ Gladiator** - You've chosen the language that's powerful enough to build anything and complex enough to break everything. You manage memory manually because you don't trust anyone else to do it right. Your template errors read like ancient curses written in a long-dead language!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Go]="üîµ **Go Minimalist** - You've embraced the philosophy that less is more, except when it comes to error handling - then more is definitely more! 'if err != nil' is basically your personal mantra. You write code so simple that other developers think you're hiding the complexity somewhere else!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Rust]="ü¶Ä **Rust Evangelist** - You've discovered the holy grail of programming languages and won't let anyone forget it! You fight the borrow checker more often than most people fight traffic. But hey, at least when your code compiles, you KNOW it's safe - safer than a helicopter parent watching their kid cross the street!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[TypeScript]="üî∑ **TypeScript Perfectionist** - JavaScript wasn't complicated enough for you, so you added types! You spend more time arguing with the TypeScript compiler than most people spend arguing with their spouse. But at least your 'any' type usage clearly shows your commitment to type safety!"

# Additional sophisticated roasting patterns
COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[emotional]="üò≠ **Emotional Commit Messages** - Your commit history reads like a developer's diary! 'WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK', 'finally got it working', 'I hate this project' - it's like watching someone's mental health journey through git log. At least you're honest about the struggle!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[timestamps]="‚è∞ **Timestamp Confessions** - Your commit messages include timestamps like '3am fix' and 'friday night debugging session'. You're documenting your poor life choices in version control! Future archaeologists will study your commits to understand the decline of work-life balance in the 21st century!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[profanity]="ü§¨ **Colorful Language Artist** - Your commit messages would make a sailor blush! You've turned git log into an R-rated experience. At least when someone runs 'git blame', they'll know EXACTLY how you felt about that particular piece of code!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[novel_length]="üìö **The Commit Novelist** - Your commit messages are longer than most people's emails! You write commit descriptions like you're documenting the complete history of human civilization. Meanwhile, other developers write 'fix' and call it a day. The contrast is... educational!"

COMMIT_MESSAGE_ROASTS[cryptic_codes]="üîê **Cryptic Code Master** - Your commit messages look like secret agent codes: 'BUG-1337: refactor xyz module w/ new algo'. You've turned version control into a puzzle game! Future developers will need a decoder ring to understand what you actually changed!"

# Repository pattern roasts with more humor
REPOSITORY_ROASTS[README_collector]="üìÑ **README Collector** - You have more README files than actual code! Your repositories are like museums - 90%% documentation, 10%% exhibits. You've perfected the art of describing what you're going to build instead of actually building it. At least your intentions are well-documented!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[todo_app_creator]="‚úÖ **Todo App Connoisseur** - You've created the same todo application in 47 different frameworks! You're like the developer equivalent of someone who keeps starting diet plans on Monday. But hey, at least you're consistent in your inconsistency!"

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[unfinished_masterpieces]="üé® **Unfinished Masterpiece Curator** - Your repositories are like art galleries full of half-finished paintings.

REPOSITORY_ROASTS[commit_timestamp_confessor]="‚è∞ **Timestamp Confessor** - Your commit messages document your poor life choices: '3AM fix', 'Sunday debugging', 'why am I doing this at midnight'. You're creating a permanent record of your self-destructive coding habits. Future archaeologists will study your commits to understand developer burnout!"

# Coding pattern enhancements with more sophisticated detection
CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[documentation_avoider]="üìù **The Documentation Ghost** - You write code like you're protecting state secrets. Your functions are mysteries, your variables are riddles, and your README is a haiku of confusion. Comments? Those are for other developers - you live dangerously!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[refactoring_perfectionist]="üîÑ **The Eternal Refactorer** - You refactor code more often than people change clothes. Your git history shows the same function being rewritten 47 times. You're like a digital sculptor who never stops chiseling, convinced that perfection is just one more refactor away!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[feature_branch_abandoner]="üèöÔ∏è **The Feature Branch Cemetery** - Your repositories are graveyards of abandoned feature branches. 'feature/add-login', 'hotfix/maybe-this-works', 'experimental/probably-broken' - each one a monument to good intentions and short attention spans!"

CODING_PATTERN_ROASTS[merge_conflict_warrior]="‚öîÔ∏è **The Merge Conflict Warrior** - You resolve merge conflicts like you're negotiating peace treaties between warring code factions. Your git history reads like a diplomatic crisis. You've seen things in diff tools that would make other developers weep!"

Your browser bookmarks are 90% programming solutions. You don't just stand on the shoulders of giants - you photocopy their entire bodies!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Java]="‚òï **Java Verbosity Master** - You write code so verbose it needs its own table of contents. Your 'Hello World' program is longer than most novels. You've mastered the art of saying in 100 lines what Python says in 5. But those enterprise paychecks though..."

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[C++]="‚ö° **C++ Masochist** - You voluntarily manage memory in an age of garbage collectors. You're like someone who chooses to walk everywhere when Uber exists. Your pointers have better navigation skills than most GPS systems. Respect for the old-school dedication!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Python]="üêç **Python Zen Master** - Your code is so readable that non-programmers think they can code. You've embraced the 'batteries included' philosophy so hard you've forgotten how to implement a linked list. But hey, life's too short for curly braces!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Go]="üöÄ **Go Minimalist** - You've chosen the language that makes simplicity feel complicated. Your error handling has more 'if err != nil' than actual logic. You're building the future with goroutines and channels while everyone else is still arguing about async/await!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[Rust]="ü¶Ä **Rust Safety Evangelist** - You've chosen the language that makes C++ developers feel like they've been living dangerously. Your code compiles once and runs forever, but writing it takes longer than the heat death of the universe. Your borrow checker is more overprotective than helicopter parents!"

LANGUAGE_ROASTS[CSS]="üé® **CSS Wizard** - You make pixels dance with magic spells like 'display: flex' and 'position: absolute'. You've memorized browser compatibility tables like they're religious texts. Your divs are centered both horizontally and vertically, which makes you basically a superhero!"
